# data_analysis_code
This repository hosts example code for use in data analysis. The code included in this repository is from multiple sources such as Dalgaard's Introductory Statistics with R, Chistoph Molnar's Interpretable Machine Learning, and Lovelace et al.'s Geocomputation with R. These references are not exhaustive.

I attempt to use publically available or otherwise published datasets as examples rather than my own research data. 

Stay tuned for any further updates.
